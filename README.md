 Fixed Budget & Timeline – No room for frequent changes.
 Low Customer Involvement During Development – Clients only need the final product.

Examples of Waterfall Projects:
 Construction & Infrastructure – Bridges, highways, and buildings.
 Government or Military Systems – Large-scale, security-sensitive projects.
 Enterprise Software Implementations – ERP systems or healthcare management software.
 Manufacturing & Hardware Development – Physical product design where changes are costly.




## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Requirement Analysis & Clear Documentation – Ensures that all project requirements are well-defined and understood before development starts.

✅ 2. Code Reviews & Pair Programming – Helps catch bugs and improve code quality through peer reviews.

✅ 3. Automated Testing – Includes unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing to catch issues early.

✅ 4. Manual Testing – QA engineers conduct functional, usability, and exploratory testing to identify issues that automation may miss.

✅ 5. Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Ensures that code is tested and deployed frequently, reducing integration issues.

✅ 6. Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Developers write tests before coding, ensuring functionality meets expectations.

✅ 7. Performance & Security Testing – Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures the software can handle expected loads.

✅ 8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Involves end users testing the software to ensure it meets their needs before final release.

✅ 9. Monitoring & Feedback Loops – Collects real-time user feedback and monitors system performance post-deployment.

Why Maintaining High Standards is Important
🔹 Enhances User Satisfaction – Bug-free software provides a better user experience.
🔹 Reduces Costs & Time – Fixing issues early prevents expensive rework later.
🔹 Improves Security – Prevents vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches.
